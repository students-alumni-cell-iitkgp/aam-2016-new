		<h1>Students' Alumni Cell</h1>
			<p>Over the course of past few years, Students' Alumni Cell has emerged as a key organ of
			 the Office of Alumni Affairs and International Relations in executing its yearlong events and 
			 activities. Students' Alumni Cell continuously endeavours to strengthen the relations of the alumni 
			 of this Institute and their alma mater. 
			Formed as and operating under the Dean, Alumni Affairs and International Relations, Students' Alumni Cell has
			 been instrumental in organizing the Annual Alumni Meet and Regional Student-Alumni Meets, publishing the 
			 quarterly alumni newsletter (KGPian), the annual literary magazine (Yearnings of Yore) and the Annual Yearbook. 
			Along with these, the Cell organises regular guest lectures by distinguished alumni via the initiatives "Guest 
			Lecture Conclave" and the "E-Guest Lecture Series". 
			Students' Alumni Cell also operates the Student - Alumni Mentorship Programme, My Imprint 
			(Giving Back - Alumni contribution) and organises Alvida (the annual farewell dinner).</p>
